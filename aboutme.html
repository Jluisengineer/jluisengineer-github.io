                I am a recent graduate from Fintech Wales, where I earned a Data Analyst certification after completing my degree in Civil Engineering. 
                My academic and professional background has equipped me with transferable skills such as 
                mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, and problem-solving that I leverage in my work as a data analyst. 
                <br><br> Since January 2023, I have been working as a junior data analyst at <strong>Yustimar S.L</strong>, 
                where I have been responsible for analyzing large datasets, building predictive models, 
                and developing dashboards and visualizations to communicate insights to stakeholders.
                <br><br> I am skilled in several programming languages, including R, Python, PHP and SQL.
                I have also gained experience using popular data visualization tools such as Excel, Tableau, and Power BI.

                I believe in values such as respect, loyalty, and friendship, which guide me both personally and 
                professionally. In my work as a data analyst, I prioritize open communication, collaboration, and respect for my colleagues and clients. 
                I believe that building strong relationships based on trust and mutual respect is essential 
                for achieving success and making a positive impact in the world. <br><br>
                Overall, I am a dedicated and driven individual who is committed to making a positive impact 
                in the world through my work as a data analyst and my personal relationships with others. 
                I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow, and 
                I am excited to see where my career and passions take me in the future.

                Outside of work, I enjoy playing guitar, reading books, watching movies, and cooking. 
                These hobbies help me to relax and recharge, and I find that they also provide an opportunity to connect 
                with others and share my passion for music and food.
