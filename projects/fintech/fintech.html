        <h1>Fintech Wales / Iungo Solutions</h1>
        <p class="size13 justify">I recently completed a Data Analyst course with Fintech Wales and Iungo Solutions, where I gained hands-on experience working on various projects. <br><br> 
          Throughout the course, I worked on three significant projects that allowed me to develop my skills in data analysis and visualization. <br> 
          One of my projects involved creating a dashboard using Tableau that focused on COVID-19, while another project involved analyzing chicken meat prices. <br>
          Lastly, I also created a report on traffic accidents in the UK. Through these projects, I gained a deeper understanding of data analysis techniques and the importance of effective data visualization in communicating insights.</p>

              <strong> Purpose of the project: </strong><br>
              The purpose of this project is to investigate, create, and implement a system that will migrate data from a spreadsheet to a relational database system. <br>
              The database system will be equipped with suitable analysis tools that can evaluate current performance. <br> 
              Additionally, a data analysis is conducted on the causes of accidents in the United Kingdom.
